Hello <%= @user.name %>,

GOV.UK Signon accounts are suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

Your <%= account_name %> will be suspended <%= suspension_time %> and you will not be able to access any GOV.UK applications.

You’ll need to sign in to your account to stop it being suspended.

If you’re unable to sign in to your account because you’ve forgotten your passphrase, you can request a new one on the sign in screen.
